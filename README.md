# firefox-esr: Homebrew tap for Firefox ESR versions

Casks of [Firefox Extended Support Releases (ESR)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/)
currently supported by Mozilla.
Each cask will be introduced and removed in parallel with Mozillaâ€™s support.

Subsequent Firefox ESR versions overlap by two major versions (twelve weeks),
during which you may choose to manually update to the latest ESR (or other
release) of Firefox.

Current versions:

* `firefox-esr38` (released 2015-03-31, [scheduled to retire 2016-06-07](https://wiki.mozilla.org/RapidRelease/Calendar))
* `firefox-esr45` (released 2016-03-08, scheduled to retire 2017Q1)
* `firefox-esr-latest` (will always contain the latest ESR)

All versions use the US-English locale `en-US`.

## Usage

"Tap" the repo and install the desired version:

```
brew tap tjanson/firefox-esr
brew cask install firefox-esr45
```

You may also want to look at other possible versions of Firefox with
`brew cask search firefox`.
